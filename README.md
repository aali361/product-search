In this project we use a data set from a company named Diginetica. This data has
two important column 'Searching.Toekns' and 'Products'. In fact a query that
contains number of tokens matched to the number of Items. We use this data to
learn vector of each Token and Product. For this purpose we use algorithm named
BiNE.

After creating the vectors we do evaluation on test section of data. We used
measurements like MAP, MRR and NDCG for evaluate our system.
